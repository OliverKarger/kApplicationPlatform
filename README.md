# kApplicationPlatform

**kApplicationPlatform** is a modular, plugin-based application platform designed to support dynamic systems, real-time extensibility, and scriptable behavior across multiple operating systems.

The platform is intended to load and manage external applications ("plugins") that interact with shared subsystems, execute in isolated contexts, and optionally expose their functionality to scripting engines for automation or dynamic control.

## Goals

- Provide a structured environment for running modular applications
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous execution models
- Enable fault-tolerant execution and recoverability of individual components
- Centralize core system services like logging, IO, communication, and scripting
- Enable inter-component messaging and event-driven communication
- Expose a runtime scripting interface for dynamic control and automation
- Support cross-platform development (e.g., Linux and Windows)
- Enable developers to extend the platform without modifying its core

## Architecture Overview

### Core Concepts

- **Application Platform (AP)**: The central system responsible for loading, executing, and managing plugins, services, and scripting environments.
- **Plugins**: Independently developed components loaded at runtime, following a defined interface or entry point contract.
- **Execution Modes**: Each plugin declares whether it runs synchronously (in the platformâ€™s main loop) or asynchronously (in a separate execution context).
- **Service State**: Plugins receive access to a set of thread-safe or isolated subsystems (e.g., logging, IO, networking, scripting).
- **Crash Isolation**: Plugin code runs within guarded execution boundaries to detect faults and allow for safe recovery or restarting.
- **Scripting Interface**: A scriptable layer enables automation, orchestration, and runtime logic via macros or embedded scripts.
- **External Plugin State**: The platform may persist or manage per-plugin state outside the plugin itself to enable reloads and recovery.

## Feature Highlights

- Runtime plugin discovery and dynamic loading
- Synchronous or asynchronous plugin execution
- Per-plugin service containers for logging, IO, etc.
- Event-driven messaging between components
- Optional scripting runtime to access and control the system
- Platform-managed lifecycle and restart logic for plugins
- Abstracted interfaces to allow future integration of scripting languages or service backends

## Plugin Lifecycle Overview

1. Discover and load the plugin module
2. Determine execution mode (sync/async)
3. Allocate and assign services (logging, IO, etc.)
4. Initialize plugin with system state and (optional) persistent state
5. Execute plugin in a guarded context
6. If failure occurs, isolate, unload, and restart the plugin
